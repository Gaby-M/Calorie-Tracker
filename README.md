Created a program that allows users to input the calories for each meal and day,
and it creates a report that includes the following:

1. Total caloric consumption for each day of the week
2. Average daily caloric consumption for the whole week
3. The smallest number of calories eaten during the week in any of the meals
4. The biggest number of calories eaten during the week in any of the meals
